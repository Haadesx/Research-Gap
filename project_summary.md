# Research Gap Identifier Project Summary

## Project Overview
The Research Gap Identifier is a web application that allows users to upload multiple research papers and uses Google's Gemini API to analyze them for research gaps. The application helps researchers identify potential areas for further research by analyzing the content of multiple papers together.

## Completed Tasks

### Project Structure and Setup
- Created a comprehensive project structure with clear separation of frontend and backend
- Set up all necessary configuration files (package.json, .env.example, .gitignore)
- Created detailed documentation (README.md, steps.md)
- Configured deployment settings for Vercel

### Frontend Development
- Created a responsive user interface with modern design
- Implemented drag-and-drop file upload functionality
- Built a file management system for handling uploaded papers
- Designed results display for showing identified research gaps
- Added loading indicators and user feedback mechanisms
- Implemented responsive design for mobile and desktop use

### Backend Development
- Set up Node.js server with Express
- Created API endpoints for paper analysis
- Implemented file handling for uploaded documents
- Set up text extraction functionality using PDF.js
- Established Gemini API integration with effective prompts
- Implemented comprehensive error handling

### Deployment Preparation
- Created Vercel configuration for seamless deployment
- Set up environment variable management
- Prepared detailed deployment instructions

## Remaining Tasks

### Testing
- Test PDF text extraction with various PDF formats
- Test the Gemini API integration with actual papers
- Verify error handling for API limits and failures
- Conduct end-to-end testing of the complete workflow

### Deployment
- Deploy the application to Vercel or Netlify
- Configure environment variables on the hosting platform
- Verify functionality in the production environment

### Enhancements (Future Work)
- Improve PDF text extraction quality
- Add better support for DOC/DOCX files
- Implement citation analysis functionality
- Add visualization of connections between papers
- Create a user account system for saving analyses
- Add export functionality for analysis results

## How to Proceed
1. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`
2. Set up your Google Gemini API key in the `.env` file
3. Download PDF.js files as mentioned in the placeholder
4. Run the application locally with `npm run dev`
5. Test the functionality with sample research papers
6. Deploy to Vercel or Netlify using the configuration provided

## Lessons Learned
- Working with PDFs in the browser requires careful handling
- Effective prompt engineering is essential for good results from AI models
- API response parsing needs robust error handling
- Handling file uploads requires careful validation and processing
- Modern UI can be achieved with plain HTML/CSS/JS without frameworks
