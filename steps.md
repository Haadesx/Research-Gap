# Research Gap Identifier Project Plan

## Overview
This project has created a web application that uses Google's Gemini API to identify research gaps across multiple research papers. Users can upload papers, and the system analyzes them to identify potential areas for further research.

## Architecture
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- AI: Google Gemini API
- Hosting: Vercel or Netlify (free tier)

## Lessons
- **PDF.js Integration**: Downloading libraries via PowerShell's curl command had issues on Windows. Instead, we created a placeholder file with instructions for manually downloading the required libraries and added initialization scripts to automate this process.
- **Project Structure**: We organized the project with a clear separation between frontend and backend code, making it more maintainable.
- **API Design**: We designed the backend to handle both direct text analysis and file uploads, providing flexibility for different client scenarios.
- **Error Handling**: We implemented comprehensive error handling in the backend for both API requests and response parsing.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Designed the Gemini API prompts to output structured JSON data, making it easier to process and display the results.
- **Deployment Automation**: Created configuration files and scripts to simplify the deployment process to Vercel.
